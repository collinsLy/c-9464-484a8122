Pre-calculate and display accurate balances instantly after login with no loading delay.

🧠 Brainstorm / Optimization Plan:
🔁 1. Cache Prices at Login
Fetch all prices immediately after login, not when navigating to the dashboard.

Store them in a global state (e.g., Redux, Zustand, or React context) so the dashboard instantly has access.

Optionally use localStorage or IndexedDB to persist prices between sessions and reduce fetches.

✅ Implementation idea:
ts
Copy
Edit
// On login success
useEffect(() => {
  fetchAllPrices().then(setPriceStore);
}, [user?.uid]);
⚡ 2. Precompute Portfolio Value After Login
Once the prices and user balances are fetched:

Calculate portfolio totals right away in memory.

Store them in state and display them directly on the dashboard.

✅ Example:
ts
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  if (prices && userAssets) {
    const totalValue = computePortfolioValue(userAssets, prices);
    setPortfolioTotal(totalValue);
  }
}, [prices, userAssets]);
⏱️ 3. Use Parallel Fetching
Don’t fetch prices or balances sequentially.

Use Promise.all() to get all price data and asset balances in parallel.

ts
Copy
Edit
const fetchInitialData = async () => {
  const [assets, prices] = await Promise.all([
    fetchUserAssets(uid),
    fetchTokenPrices(),
  ]);
  setAssets(assets);
  setPrices(prices);
};
🚀 4. Loading UX: Optimistic UI or Placeholder Skeleton
Even if there's a <1s delay, you can show:

“Last Known Value”

Skeleton loader with shimmer

“Updating in real time...” with spinner

So it doesn't feel stuck or broken.

📦 5. Use a Lightweight Pricing API or Cache It on Server
If you're using a slow pricing API (like CoinGecko free tier), consider:

Switching to a faster provider (e.g., CoinCap, CoinMarketCap Pro)

Hosting your own mini Firebase function to cache prices every 60s and serve instantly to the frontend

🛑 6. Prevent Re-fetching Prices Repeatedly
Your logs show prices being fetched more than once — this could be because each component (e.g., per asset row) fetches price again.

Make sure:

Prices are fetched once

Then shared across components via context or global state.

✅ Summary Plan (High Level):
🔐 On login: fetch balances + prices → compute total → cache in global state

📊 Dashboard: read precomputed data from state → instantly render

⚡ Ensure all price fetches are done in parallel, and once only

🔄 Optionally cache prices using localStorage or a serverless function to reduce load
