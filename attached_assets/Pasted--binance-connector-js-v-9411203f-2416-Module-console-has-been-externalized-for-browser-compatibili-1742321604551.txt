Explanation

Understanding the problem
The error Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined arises because the code within @binance/connector/src/helpers/utils.js is attempting to use the process global variable, which is only available in Node.js environments. The error shows that the code is being run in the web browser, where process is not defined. This usually occurs when a library designed for Node.js is mistakenly included and run directly within a browser environment. In this case the file utils.js includes the line stdout: process.stdout, which is using process variable, and that is causing the error.

How to verify
Environment check: Examine the context where the code is running. The stack trace shows that it's running in a browser environment, as indicated by the presence of file names like chunk-4MBMRILA.js.
Library's intended environment: Check if the @binance/connector library is intended for both Node.js and browser environments. Often, Node.js libraries require specific adaptations to work in the browser.
Check Library bundle: If you're using a bundler like Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel, examine the bundle configuration to ensure that Node.js-specific code is not inadvertently being included in the browser bundle.
