Cryptocurrency Conversion Blueprint
🌐 1. User Interface (Front-End Layer)
🔹 Components:
Select From/To Token

Enter Amount

Live Exchange Rate

Swap/Convert Button

Estimated Fees + Slippage Info

Receive Preview

💡 UX Best Practices:
Auto-detect wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect)

Show real-time rates

Display expected network fee, execution time

Confirm via modal before executing

🧠 2. Conversion Logic (Application Layer)
🚀 A. Input Validation
Ensure valid wallet address, supported tokens, sufficient balance.

Limit decimal places based on token precision (e.g., 8 for BTC, 18 for ETH).

🔁 B. Rate Fetching
Get real-time quote using:

Aggregators: 1inch, Paraswap, Matcha

DEX APIs: Uniswap, PancakeSwap, SushiSwap

CEX APIs: Binance, Coinbase Pro

📉 C. Slippage Calculation
Calculate price impact (slippage) based on order size vs liquidity pool.

Let users set slippage tolerance (e.g., 0.5%, 1%).

🔒 3. Authorization (Wallet & Signing)
📝 Token Approval (ERC-20)
If it’s the first time swapping, the user must approve the smart contract to spend tokens.

🔐 Signing Transaction
Prompt user to sign the transaction via wallet (MetaMask, Ledger, etc.)

⛓️ 4. On-Chain Execution (Blockchain Layer)
🔁 Swap Routes
Use optimal routing: swap via intermediate tokens (e.g., swap A → B → C for best rate).

Multi-path routes can reduce slippage.

📤 Transaction Broadcast
Send signed transaction to blockchain.

Wait for confirmations (can use WebSocket or polling).

⚙️ 5. Post-Processing
📩 Confirmation:
Display transaction hash & block explorer link.

Update wallet balance.

Trigger notifications (e.g., Brevo email or in-app toast).

🧾 Logging:
Save transaction details (UID, tokenFrom, tokenTo, amountIn, amountOut, txHash, status).

Log error codes for failed attempts.

🔐 6. Security + Risk Mitigation
Rate Timeout: Invalidate quote after 10–30 seconds.

Slippage Cap: Warn or reject swaps above threshold.

Front-Running Protection: Use deadline field in transaction.

Gas Estimation: Provide upper limit estimates.
