 GET https://cryptopanic.com/api/v1/posts/?auth_token=8bff507…&kind=news net::ERR_FAILED 301 (Moved Permanently)
Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console message GET https://cryptopanic.com/api/v1/posts/?auth_token=8bff507…&kind=news net::ERR_FAILED 301 (Moved Permanently) indicates that your application attempted to fetch data from https://cryptopanic.com/api/v1/posts/, but the server responded with a 301 Moved Permanently status code. This means that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URL, and the server provides the new URL in the Location header of the response. In this specific case the new URL is /api/free/v1/posts/?auth_token=8bff507b6560f15012d5dbb6899e54ca009818c3&kind=news and it appears that the API is now available under the /api/free/v1 path. The net::ERR_FAILED suggests that the browser didn't handle the redirection automatically, or failed to fetch the new URL. This is likely because your application isn't set up to handle redirects. The provided stack trace indicates the issue originates in the MarketNews.tsx file, specifically around line 20, where you're likely making the fetch call, and the react life cycle events afterwards. Finally, the code you provided for the error doesn't seem to be the origin of the error, the code seems to be a proxy function for the fetch api.

How to verify
Inspect the Network Tab: Open Chrome DevTools, navigate to the "Network" tab, and reload the page. Find the failing request (it should have a red status).
Check Response Headers: Click on the failing request and examine the "Headers" tab. You should see a 301 Moved Permanently status and a Location header with the new URL (/api/free/v1/posts/?auth_token=...).
Directly Access the New URL: Copy the Location header value (the new URL) and paste it into your browser's address bar. You should be able to access the resource without a redirect, confirming the server's redirection.
Check fetch call The fetch call, in MarketNews.tsx, should be sending a GET request to the https://cryptopanic.com/api/v1/posts/ URL, and this should be changed to the new URL.
Suggested fix
The solution is to update the base URL in your application to use /api/free/v1/posts/ instead of /api/v1/posts/.
