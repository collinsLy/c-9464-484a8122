TransactionHistory.tsx:29 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: UserService.getUserData is not a function
    at fetchTransactions (TransactionHistory.tsx:29:46)
    at TransactionHistory.tsx:37:5
Explanation

Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: UserService.getUserData is not a function indicates that you are trying to call a function named getUserData on the UserService object, but it is not defined as a function. This likely means that either the function name is misspelled, the function is not implemented in the UserService, or there's an issue with how UserService is imported or instantiated. The error occurs within the fetchTransactions function in your TransactionHistory.tsx component, specifically at line 29, which corresponds to the line const userData = await UserService.getUserData(uid);.

How to verify
Check UserService: Ensure that UserService actually has a method named getUserData. Review the UserService file to confirm the function's definition and that there are no typos in the name.
Inspect Imports: Verify that UserService is correctly imported into TransactionHistory.tsx. Check for any potential issues with the import path or naming mismatches.
Review Exports: If UserService is in a separate file, ensure that getUserData is correctly exported from that file.
Suggested fix
Correct the function name: If there's a typo in the function name (either in the call or the definition), correct it to ensure they match exactly.
Implement the function: If the function is missing in UserService, add the getUserData method with its intended logic. For example:
Code

// In UserService.ts

class UserService {
  // ... other methods ...

  async getUserData(uid: string) {
    // Implement the logic to fetch user data based on uid
    // For example, fetch from an API or database
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${uid}`); // Replace with your actual API endpoint
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Failed to fetch user data');
    }
    return response.json();
  }
}

export default UserService;
Use code snippets with caution

Correct the import: Ensure the import statement in TransactionHistory.tsx correctly points to the UserService file and uses the correct name.
Code

// In TransactionHistory.tsx
import UserService from './UserService'; // Adjust the path if necessary
Use code snippets with caution

Instantiation: If UserService is a class, make sure it's correctly instantiated before use.
Code

// In TransactionHistory.tsx
import UserService from './UserService'; 

// ... inside your component ...
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchTransactions = async () => {
      if (!isDemoMode) {
        const uid = localStorage.getItem('userId');
        if (uid) {
          const userService = new UserService(); // Instantiate UserService
          const userData = await userService.getUserData(uid); // Use the instance
          if (userData && userData.transactions) {
            setTransactions(userData.transactions);
          }
        }
      }
    };

    fetchTransactions();
  }, [isDemoMode]);
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
The error occurs because the getUserData function is not defined in the UserService or there is a problem with how the function is called or imported. Verify the function's definition, its import into the component, and its usage. If the function is missing, implement it in UserService. If UserService is a class, ensure it is instantiated before calling its methods.
